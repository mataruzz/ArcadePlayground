Welcome to the Arcade Platform! This project is built using Qt and C++ to provide a rich, interactive, and user-friendly gaming experience. This project began as an opportunity to learn the Qt library and understand its working principles. The platform hosts a variety of classic games, with the initial release featuring Tic Tac Toe (and now Tetris). Future releases will include more exciting games.
